# Propagation

A supersonic cross platform synchronous ASIO device manager and audio routing
application.

## Cool description and all, but what is Propagation?

Propagation is a multiplatform audio driver that enables audiophiles to route
application audio through any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) of their choice.

- All audio streams created by Propagation are synchronized to a physical audio
interface to mitigate clock drift and buffer underrun problems.

- Distinct applications can be routed to Propagation created endpoints. This
allows for the virtual passthrough of audio that can be captured by recording
devices and software alike.

- The routing of application audio can be controlled given specific system
directory paths. All applications under a certain directory and its subdirectory
can be routed to a specific endpoint. For instance, when the steamapps directory
is specified then every application under that directory can be routed to a
singular endpoint.
